## Hi 👋, I'm Viswanathan (Viswa) - Software Principal Engineer | Hardware Diagnostics | .NET Expert
I specialize in hardware diagnostic, device telemetry and high performance .NET applications used by millions of device in the field.

Over the last decade, I have built, modernized, and optimized diagnostic platforms across Windows echo systems - from WPF to UWP, from on-the-box agents to Azure connected services.

## What I do?
- 🛠️ Hardware Diagnostics - End-to-end enablmenet of CPU, memory, sensors, cameras, audio, networking, storage and thermal systems
- 💻 C#, .NET, WPF, UWP, XAML - Architecting modern, high performance Windows applications
- ☁️ Azure - Device telemetry, Web applicaitons depoloyed Microsoft azure using App services, cdn, gateways, etc.
- 🚀 Performance optimization - Faster runtime, reduced CPU, improved memory footprintd
- 📦 On-the-box applicaitons - Field ready diagnostics, telemetry agents, update modules, etc

## Leadership & Impact
- Led a 15-member global team to modernize WPF apps into UWP, shipped through Microsoft Store
- Currently leading an 8-engineer diagnostics team as Tech Lead, Scrum Master & Scrum-of-Scrum Master
